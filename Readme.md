4. What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
Event Delegation means attaching a single event listener to a parent element instead of adding individual listeners to each child. When an event occurs on a child (like clicking a button), it bubbles up to the parent, where you can catch it and respond accordingly.
Why it is useful:
I am answering this question based on my assignment.
1.Dynamically add new box to call history section.
2.Handling clicks on Call and Copy buttons inside each card.
3.Updating coin and copy counts, showing alerts, and inserting new elements.
